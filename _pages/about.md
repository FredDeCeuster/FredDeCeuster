I'm a <strong>postdoctoral research fellow</strong> of the [Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)](https://www.fwo.be/en/), leading the computational research division in the group of [Prof. Dr. Leen Decin](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/staff/senior-staff/leen-decin) at the [Institute of Astronomy](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster) ([KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/)).

Our research revolves around modelling <strong>evolved stars</strong> as they shed their outer layers, enriching our Universe with the chemicals they produce, providing the building blocks for future generations of stars, planets, and perhaps even life.
This involves <strong>3D hydrodynamics</strong>, <strong>chemical kinetics</strong>, and <strong>radiative transfer</strong> modelling.
As observations reveal ever more intricate structures (see e.g. [Decin et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb1229)) our models become ever more complex, and it becomes increasingly difficult to compare them to observations.
In our computational research team, we tackle this problem is several different ways, with:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Probabilistic 3D reconstruction</strong> of observations, to create data-augmented models that can account for the observed complexities;</li>
  <li><strong>Fast surrogate models</strong>, using machine learning to train fast and quantifiably approximate models to by-pass expensive modelling steps, such as chemical kinetics and radiative transfer;</li>
  <li>Efficient use of <strong>high-performance computing</strong> resources, developing solutions that can leverage multi-node many-core systems as well as (multi-)GPU systems. </li>
</ul>

My personal research interests encompass a broad range of topics at the interface between mathematics, physics, and engineering.
Currently, I am mainly focussed on developing efficient methods for 3D reconstruction of astronomical observations to compare with our complex theoretical models, using variational Bayesian methods and probabilistic numerics.

I obtained a <strong>PhD</strong> in computational astrophysics from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), working with [Revd. Dr. Jeremy Yates](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/dr-jeremy-yates), [Prof. Dr. Peter Boyle](https://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~paboyle/), and [Prof. Dr. James Hetherington](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/honorary-fellows/james-hetherington). Here, I started developing [Magritte](/projects/magritte/): a software library for 3D radiative transfer and synthetic obsevations.

For a gentle introduction to my PhD research, see e.g. this [#ThesisThread](https://twitter.com/FredDeCeuster/status/1446114019421552641).

Prior to that, I obtained a <strong>BSc</strong> and <strong>MSc</strong> in Physics from [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/).
